This is the repo containing the web interface for Colossus.

# Setup and running Colossus Web

## MacOS / Linux

```bash
bash script.sh
```

## Windows

```bash
script.bat
```

# Running on Astro Server

Run 'module load icc/latest' before running pip. That will put xiar, ifort,
etc. in your $PATH. Hopefully it will compile then.
